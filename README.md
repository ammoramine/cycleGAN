# style_transfer_proj

implementation of cycleGan for conversion between apple and facebook emoticones.
I would add in subsequent versions, the possibility to add patch for differents possible dataset, and also as an intermediary step, the same version applied on celeb dataset .
I will add later instructions for the installation of the projet as package.




random quote  from fluent in python (of Luciano Ramalho), quoting another programmer: 

When I see patterns in my programs, I consider it a sign of trouble. The shape of a program
should reflect only the problem it needs to solve. Any other regularity in the code is a
sign, to me at least, that I’m using abstractions that aren’t powerful enough—often that
I’m generating by hand the expansions of some macro that I need to write.1
